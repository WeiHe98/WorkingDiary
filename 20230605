Objective: Build circuits monitoring PV panel/battery/AC load voltage/current, sending data to microSD and cloud
    √ Microcontroller type: Adafruit HUZZAH32 Feather
    √ Blink
    Read 3.3V voltage from board with 0-25V voltage sensor: Ongoing
        √ Using Arduino UNO to check voltage sensor functionality
            √ 5V, √ 3.3V (same code)
        √ Using ESP32 Feather to measure Arduino UNO 5V
            × wrong answer -> either ESP32 Feather ADC problem or Code problem
        Using same code but with ESP32 FireBeetle (FireBeetle 2 ESP32-E)
            √ Blink
            × Measure 3.3V it produces with 0-25V voltage sensor: disconnect everything while still some value is detected from analog input
            Noise: Connect ADC pin with 0.1uF and ground
    Read PV voltage and current, display on serial port
