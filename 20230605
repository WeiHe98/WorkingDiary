Objective: Build circuits monitoring PV panel/battery/AC load voltage/current, sending data to microSD and cloud
    √ Microcontroller type: Adafruit HUZZAH32 Feather
    √ Blink
    Read 3.3V voltage from board with 0-25V voltage sensor: Ongoing
        √ Using Arduino UNO to check voltage sensor functionality
            √ 5V, √ 3.3V (same code)
        √ Using ESP32 Feather to measure Arduino UNO 5V, wrong answer -> either ESP32 Feather ADC problem or Code problem
        Using same code but with ESP32 FireBeetle
    Read PV voltage and current, display on serial port
