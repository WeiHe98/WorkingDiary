Objective: Build circuits monitoring PV panel/battery/AC load voltage/current, sending data to microSD and cloud. Using deep sleep mode to reduce power consumption
    √ Microcontroller type: Adafruit HUZZAH32 Feather
    √ Blink
    √ Read 3.3V voltage from board with 0-25V voltage sensor
        √ Using Arduino UNO to check voltage sensor functionality
            √ 5V, √ 3.3V (same code)
        √ Using ESP32 Feather to measure Arduino UNO 5V
            × wrong answer -> either ESP32 Feather ADC problem or Code problem
        √ Using same code but with ESP32 FireBeetle (FireBeetle 2 ESP32-E)
            √ Blink
            √ Measure 3.3V it produces with 0-25V voltage sensor: disconnect everything while still some value is detected from analog input
            Noise: Connect ADC pin with 0.1uF and ground; multisampling
            ADC non-linearity: use look up table

            √ × Initial SD card with ESP32: CS defined as D7 is fine, but D3 is not working; 
                why the center LED is on?
                    × Seems FastLED write code into Flash, which is always executed. Can I use this feature to reduce power consumption?
                    Cannot figure out. Prepare to disconnect the RGB LED. Suspect D8 is somehow connected with D7. Each time SD Card is initialised with D7, RGB is on. 
                Took me a LOT of time:
                    D6 should be the default CS pin of ESP32 per official tutorial, but somehow it is D7 that only works in my ESP32
                    Code copiyed from online needs to be AUTO FORMATTED
            √ Read values in SD card
            √ Merge sd card code and time data
                when wifi is somehow disconnected, the code ceased to append data into SD card
                it is also unnecessary to have access to real time every 10 seconds

    √ Use BJT to turn on/off external LED
    
    
            Write sampled value to SD card
            Wiring to detect PV panel/battery/AC load voltage/current
            Write above values to SD card
    Read PV voltage and current, display on serial port
